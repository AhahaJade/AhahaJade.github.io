abstract: In this article, we investigate the local and nonlocal failure propagation patterns in power systems and propose effective mitigation strategies. It is widely acknowledged that the sequence of failure events of component overloading is determined by power flow redistribution. To understand the power flow redistribution process, we analyze the prefault power flow condition using network flow theory and by clustering the system into several regions with balanced local power flow. We observe that faults triggering local power imbalance would lead to remote power transfer and faults causing no local power imbalance would lead to local power redistribution. The improved understanding of the failure process permits us to develop effective mitigating strategies consisting of adaptive power balance restoration and selective edge protection for cascading failure propagation. In addition, we propose a set of indexes to measure the local and nonlocal propagation risks of cascading failures. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 118- and 300-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed mitigation strategies can significantly reduce the blackout sizes and are tolerant to incorrect transmission line tripping.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
