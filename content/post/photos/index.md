Some people say photography is a form of documentation, others say it's a means of expression, and there are those who believe it should be like painting. I agree with all of these perspectives. However, in my heart, the irreplaceable aspect of photography is that it allows me to glimpse into the worlds within people's hearts. There are a thousand Hamlets in the eyes of a thousand individuals. Just like academia, each person's Google Scholar profile represents their way of thinking. The world of photography possesses the vitality of Rinko Kawauchi and the contrasting beauty of Daido Moriyama. I also hope to capture each period of my life through photographs.
