I enjoy delving into the essence of problems and appreciate the thinking involved in physics. My current research interests include challenges faced by modern power systems and the application of complex networks. Despite the long-standing development of power systems, numerous unresolved issues persist due to their inherent complexity. Furthermore, the power system of the modern era is experiencing substantial transformations. I aspire to make a valuable contribution to the establishment of this critical infrastructure.
