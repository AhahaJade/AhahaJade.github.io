My current research interests include the challenges faced by modern networked systems. The size of multiple modern infrastructure systems are scaling up, bringing complexity of their management and mainteance. Nonetheless, the requirement for flexibility of some networked systems is also increasing. Providing deeper understanding of large-scale networked systems is imperative.
